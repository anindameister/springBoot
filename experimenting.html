<h1>What are the annotations, we have learnt till now?</h1>
<ol><li>
    @Component
    <ul><li>This tells that, I authorise this class to be used as bean</li></ul>
</li>
    <li>@Scope(value="prototype")
    </li>
    <ul><li>To be noted, the default type is Singleton for Spring Boot which means that an instance of the class would be given to the other class, even without calling it</li>
    <li>with @Scope(value="prototype") , the class needs to call for the bean explicitly</li></ul>
    <li>@Autowired</li>
    <ul><li>a class' method to be called within another class' method</li>
    <li>Eg:Laptop class called by Alien.class and this Alien.class being called by DemoApplication.java</li>
    </ul>
    <li> @Autowired @Qualifier("lap1")</li>
    <ul><li>@Autowired is used to connect one class to another class on the basis of class name</li>
    <li>@Autowired @Qualifier("lap1") is used to connect a class to another class, by the other class' object name by using things like @Component("lap1")
    </li></ul>

</ol>
